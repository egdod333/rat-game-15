# RAT GAME 15
ameteur c game + development system emphasizing modularity (i 
use big words to make myself sound more photosynthesis) that s
o far has been coded exclusively by me (please ffs ari help me
out here). by me i mean the owner of the github user egdod333 
and NO usage of large language models or other sorts of genera
tive ai. i didn't even copy any code (that i can remember) (i 
did do a lot of research shoutout stackexchange, cppreference,
and desmos graphing calculator)
if you care about this at all i'm open to talk about it (might
not know what im talking about im afraid) and you can contact 
me through however you found this repo because seriously if yo
u find this by chance then i will be thoroughly astonished
i probably will forget to do a lot of pushing, you'll have to 
forgive me as i've got commitment issues.
game only works on linux machines because well the shell scrip
t to run it is pretty important so good luck getting it anywhe
re else. lmk if you find a nice way to, though. apolyglot exec
would be a really cool thing to have tbh
